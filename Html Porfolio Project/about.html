<h1>About us </h1>
<p>The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,<br> 
sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely<br> 
in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting<br>
, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, <br>
companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia,<br>
dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine<br>
 bond has been a topic of frequent study.[13] This influence on human <br>
 society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".[14]The <br>
